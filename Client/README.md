# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#to set up 
1. npm install 
2. npm run dev

# why to use fireauth and firestore both 
1. fireauth provides authentication and you can login through only if you have fireauth registered

2. in firestore it only stores it doesnt check the password or encryption things, like password must be strong it doesnt care about that .

3. Integrating Google Auth using firebase in signUp and login Page
